People will also receive a notification if you edit a comment to mention their username or team name.

Note: A person will only be notified about a mention if the person has read access to the repository and,  
if the repository is owned by an organization, the person is a member of the organization.

###Links

When you have text selected, you can paste a URL from your clipboard to automatically create a link from the selection.
